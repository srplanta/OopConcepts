There are 4 basic building blocks of OOP;
1.	Encapsulation
		Encapsulation means enclosing data members and related operations into singel unit named class.
		DataMembers + Methods = Class

2.	Inheritance
		in inheritance, child class object automatically inherits all the properties and behaviours of
		parent class object.
		(Types of Inheritance)
			i.		Single Level Inheritance
						One parent class & one child/derived class.
						Example: (A -> B)

			ii.		Multi Level Inheritance
						One child class is inherited from one parent and that one parent is also inherited
						from some other parent class.
						Example: (A -> B -> C)

			iii.	Hieraracal Inheritance
						When multiple children inherits properties of single parent class.
						Means derived classes are siblings.
						Example: (A -> B ; A -> C ; A -> D)

			iv.		Multiple Inheritance
						When one child class inherits properties of multiple parent classes.
						Example: (D -> A,B,C)

3.	Abstraction
		Abstraction is hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
		Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces

4.	Polymorphism
		Polymorphism means one class/method with many implementations.
			i.	Static/Compile time polymorphism
				Example: Method overloading

			ii.	Dynamic/Run time polymorphism
				Example: Method Overriding
